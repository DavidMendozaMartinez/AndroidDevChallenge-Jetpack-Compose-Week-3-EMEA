## :bulb: Motivation and Context
All clickable components defined in designs have a reserved part of the code that is invoked when
interacting with them. This facilitates the potential implementation of functionality that is not
required for the challenge.

All the texts that appear in the application are translatable, including the hyperlinks on the Log
in screen, regardless of whether their length is variable depending on the language.

The urls of the Pexels photos are intercepted to add the parameters to request the minimum size
necessary and in this way reduce the consumption of data and resources.
